  <h3><a href="https://emberger.xyz/reviews/hiredgun/">Necromunda: Hired Gun</a></h3>
  <div>This time I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering a RPG but a FPS. Hired Gun is a first-person shooter set in Necromunda, a spin-off setting of Warhammer 40K. The game was developed by Streumon Studio, best known for E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy. They also worked on adapting another WH40k game (Space Hulk) to a video game and are believed to be big fans of the game.

  <h3><a href="https://emberger.xyz/reviews/helenmysteriouscastle/">Helen&#39;s Mysterious Castle</a></h3>
  <div>Helen&amp;rsquo;s Mysterious Castle is a short and gentle JRPG in RPG Maker with a somewhat unique battle system. It has been developed by Satsu and been released in English on Steam. It cost 2 euros and can go for even less in sales. I do not have much information about the author but they seem to have released a couple RPG Maker games, in the same style (and one DRPG). Helen&amp;rsquo;s Mysterious Castle is a throwback with its old-school aesthetics (on RPG Maker 2000!</div>

  <h3><a href="https://emberger.xyz/reviews/lewd_reviews/sequelblight/">Sequel blight</a></h3>
  <div>Sequel blight is an independent h-game developed on RPG Maker, by the doujin circle Leaf Geometry. It is composed only of hakika, who has developed many games over the years. The game is available on DLSite. You can find a (awesome) fan translation here.
Sequel blight is a huge surprise for me. I had really a lot of fun, the gameplay is solid, the dialogs are funny and the graphics are cute.</div>

  <h3><a href="https://emberger.xyz/reviews/higurashi/">Higurashi When They Cry</a></h3>
  <div>I finished recently (yesterday) Higurashi When They Cry. I enjoyed most of the 90h-ish it took me to finish, so this will be more my impressions than a review. Higurashi When They Cry is a long Visual Novel, available on Steam and Mangagamer. It was created by a d√µjin circle known as 07th expansion, and written by Ryukishi07. The themes are friendship, kids, murders, and the paranormal. It is cut into several chapters, which are each a version of the story, taking place in the little Japanese village of Hinamizawa in June 1983.</div>

  <h3><a href="https://emberger.xyz/reviews/embraced_by_autumn/">Embraced By Autumn</a></h3>
  <div>Embraced By Autumn is a relaxing and sweet Visual Novel about love between girls with a twist, the protagonist is a cute cross-dressing boy! I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Yuri and crossdressing/gender-bender romance so I really had to play this. It is available on Steam and itch.io.
 Sceneries are well made and contributes a lot to the general atmosphere of the story   I enjoyed the writing and ambiance.</div>

  <h3><a href="https://emberger.xyz/reviews/death-end-request-review/">Death End re;Quest</a></h3>
  <div>Death End re;Quest is a game developed and produced by the Compile Heart/Idea Factory duo, released on PS4/Switch and PC.
It&amp;rsquo;s a unique JRPG with a nice atmosphere, an unseen before combat system and a big emphasis on the story. The story is conveyed via text and pictures of characters, like a Visual Novel. The game is described as half VN and while I feel it&amp;rsquo;s far-fetched since a large part of JRPG choose to present their narration this way, Death End Request includes numerous choices similar to a VN.</div>

  <h3><a href="https://emberger.xyz/reviews/hellocharlotte/">Hello Charlotte EP 1</a></h3>
  <div>Hello Charlotte Episode 1 is an exploration game made in RPG maker. It is free on itch.io so you can check it for yourself. There is no combat and you only interact with the map, talk with NPCs and avoid 1 or 2 slowly moving enemies. The game took me a bit more than an hour to beat. It is the first game in a series of 4 and other games are also available on Steam and itch.</div>
